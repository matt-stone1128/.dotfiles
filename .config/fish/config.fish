#
# config.fish — your personal fish configuration
#
# Kiro's default aliases, functions, environment and prompt settings live in:
#
#     /usr/share/kiro/fish/kiro-config.fish
#
# That file is owned by the kiro-fish-config package and is OVERWRITTEN on every
# upgrade — do not edit it. The `source` line below loads it.
#
# THIS file (~/.config/fish/config.fish) is yours. It is loaded last and never
# touched by upgrades, so it is the right place for your own settings:
#   • add your aliases, functions and variables BELOW the source line —
#     because they load last, they override the Kiro defaults
#   • to drop a Kiro default, redefine or erase it here
#     (e.g. `functions -e backup`, or `alias ll 'ls -l'`)
#   • to opt out of Kiro's defaults entirely, delete the source line
#

source /usr/share/kiro/fish/kiro-config.fish
